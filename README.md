Playing with Kotlin especially Compose Multiplatform to sing its praises

Projects under here will each have their own readme and a short entry here if they are of interest.

## Kotlin Compose Multiplatform Mobile
- [Kolapsilist](./Kolapsilist/README.md) - in progress look at how to have a list of data with collapsing and rendering alternative content when collapsed.
- [MateriallyMessy](./MateriallyMessy/README.md) - very simple use of Material resources in a pure Android Jetpack compose project.

  
## Other Stuff
If you want to wander through any of my other tech explorations, I suggest:

- [im-plausibilities](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/im-plausibilities) exploring the iMessage app extensions SDK
- [perswifting](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/perswifting) tight binary alternative to Codable that tackles the need to store subclasses
- [DDDLottie21](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/DDDlottie21) a 2021 look at alternative tools for Lottie
