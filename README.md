Playing with Kotlin especially Compose Multiplatform to sing its praises

Projects under here will each have their own readme and a short entry here if they are of interest.

## Kotlin Compose Multiplatform
Whilst initially targeting mobile, CMP examples below are being built against desktop, mostly tested on macOS, and web.

- [Kolapsilist](./Kolapsilist/README.md) - in progress look at how to have a list of data with collapsing and rendering alternative content when collapsed.
- [MateriallyMessy](./MateriallyMessy/README.md) - very simple use of Material resources in a pure Android Jetpack compose project, as base for comparison.
- [PreviewablePic](./PreviewablePic/README.md) - just showing how to use an icon and be able to preview
- _MultiLang_ - upcoming test of internationalisation presenting two languages on same screen.

- [im-plausibilities](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/im-plausibilities) exploring the iMessage app extensions SDK
- [perswifting](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/perswifting) tight binary alternative to Codable that tackles the need to store subclasses
- [DDDLottie21](https://github.com/AndyDentFree/DDDlottie21) a 2021 look at alternative tools for Lottie
