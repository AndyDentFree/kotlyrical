# MateriallyMessy
Frustratedly stupid little testbed to explore issues related to getting extended Material icons.

Isolating from other projects such as Kolapsilist so as to not delay them and also with a simplified scope of a pure Android Kotlin Compose app vs multi-platform.

Written very iteratively from a _naive viewpoint_ showing what needed to change for each simple step, rather than dropping in a bunch of GPT-generated code.
